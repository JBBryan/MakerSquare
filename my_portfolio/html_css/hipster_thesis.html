    	<h1>Hipsters</h1>
    	<p id="tagline">By Brady Bryan</p>
    	<h2>Overview</h2>
    	<p font-size="25px">Hipster is a term popularly used to denote a contemporary youth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture" font-size="30px">subculture</a> in North America and Europe primarily consisting of Millennials living in urban areas.[1] The subculture has been described as a "mutating, trans-Atlantic melting pot of styles, tastes and behavior[s]"[2] and is broadly associated with indie and alternative music, a varied non-mainstream fashion sensibility (including vintage and thrift store-bought clothes), progressive or independent political views, organic or artisanal foods, and alternative lifestyles.[3][4][5] Hipsters are stereotypically described as affluent or middle class young Bohemians who reside in gentrifying neighborhoods.[6][7]</p>
    	<h2>What the Heck is a Hipster?</h2>
    	<p>The term in its current usage first appeared in the 1990s and became particularly prominent in the 2010s,[8] being derived from earlier movements in the 1940s.[citation needed] Members of the subculture do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word hipster is often used as a pejorative to describe someone who is overly trendy or effete.[9][6] Some critics contend that the notion of the contemporary hipster is actually a myth created by marketing.[10]</p>
